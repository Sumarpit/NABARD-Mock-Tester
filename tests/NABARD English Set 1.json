    "passage": "The shift towards sustainable agriculture is no longer a choice but a necessity. With the global population projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, the pressure on food systems is immense. Conventional farming, characterized by heavy chemical use and monoculture, has degraded soil health and depleted water tables. In contrast, regenerative agriculture focuses on restoring soil biodiversity. However, the transition is fraught with challenges. Smallholder farmers, who produce 80% of the world's food, often lack the capital to invest in new technologies. Furthermore, market mechanisms rarely reward farmers for ecosystem services like carbon sequestration. Governments must intervene not just with subsidies, but with insurance products that protect farmers during this transition period. Without financial safety nets, the risk of adopting new methods is simply too high for a farmer living season-to-season.",
